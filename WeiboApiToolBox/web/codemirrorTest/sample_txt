"CodeMirror is a JavaScript library that can be used to create a relatively pleasant editor interface for code-like content - computer programs, HTML markup, and similar. If a parser has been written for the language you are editing (see below for a list of supported languages), the code will be coloured, and the editor will help you with indentation."
	(Marijn Haverbeke about CodeMirror on http://codemirror.net)

This demo shows the integration of CodeMirror for the ZK-Webframework (http://zkoss.org). 
The ZK-integration and the demo are developed and maintained by Maik Jablonski.
