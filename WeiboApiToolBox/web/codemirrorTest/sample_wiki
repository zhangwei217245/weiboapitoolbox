<!--
  MediaWiki syntax coloring parser test
-->

== Mediawiki for Codemirror ==

The wikitext used to edit [http://www.mediawiki.org MediaWiki] pages is hard for beginners to learn. Often, the internal (source) layout of a page so cluttered it's hard to see what's going on with a single glance.

'''''Syntax highlighting''''' can help (see also the picture [[File:Java keywords highlighted.png]]).

This basic MediaWiki ''parser'' colors MW syntax (aka [[w:Wikitext|"wikitext"]]), highlighting certain parts of the code for easier readability.

But it can do more: The parser also visually indicates broken code, such as this [[improperly closed link].

=== Example for list ===

* This is the first item
* This is the second item
* This is the third item

It also makes the following example table, taken from [[mw:Help:Tables]], stand out from the rest of the code, making it easier to see:

{|
|  Orange    ||   Apple   ||   more
|-
|   Bread    ||   Pie     ||   more
|-
|   Butter   || Ice cream ||  and more
|}

Syntax highlighting is the next best thing to [[w:WYSIWIG|WYSIWIG]]!
